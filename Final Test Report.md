## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: Bonus-round arithmetic (off-by-one)
- Risk Analysis Impact: 83 % coverage focused 70 % of effort on high-priority areas
- Team Communication Effectiveness: It was very good communication we use WhatsApp for texting & Google Meeting to take meetings and of course email conversation
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Automate regression with Cypress  
                             : Add accessibility risk category  
                             : Introduce static analysis (ESLint) to catch JS off-by-one earlier
