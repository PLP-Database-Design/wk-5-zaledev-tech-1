## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
|R1|Reset Game |Reset button fails to clear score or puzzle progress correctly |High|High |High |Conduct repeated reset tests; verify counters reset to zero and game state reinitialized |
|R2|Leaderboard|Scores not stored or sorted correctly in localStorage|High|High|High|Test multiple scores|
|R3|Bonus Round|Bonus not triggered after every 3 puzzles|Medium|Medium|Medium|Test sequences (3rd, 6th, 9th puzzles); confirm doubled score applied|
|R4|Hint system|Hint deduction (-2 points) misapplied or double-counted|Medium|Medium|Medium|Verify hint deduction sequence and total score after use|
|R5|Scoring|Score overflow or negative value after repeated bonuses|Low|Low|Low|Add boundary checks and validation for score value|
|R6|Responsive screen|Game layout not adapting correctly to various screen sizes|High|High|High|Apply responsive CSS grid/flexbox; test on multiple devices and breakpoints; use Chrome DevTools to simulate screens|
|R7|UI Buttons|Buttons freeze or overlap after rapid clicks|Medium|Medium|Medium|Conduct rapid-click stress test; debounce actions|
|R8|Instructions / Rules|Player misinterprets hint cost or bonus rule|Medum|Medium|Medium|Improve wording in Rules section; add in-game tooltip|
|R9|Puzzle variety|Game shows same or limited puzzles repeatedly instead of random new ones|High|High|High|Expand word database or randomize puzzle selection logic; test multiple sessions|

**Change Control:** Any scope change discussed in Teams channel → logged as issue #15

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: Bonus-round arithmetic (off-by-one)
- Risk Analysis Impact: 83 % coverage focused 70 % of effort on high-priority areas
- Team Communication Effectiveness: It was very good communication we use WhatsApp for texting & Google Meeting to take meetings and of course email conversation
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Automate regression with Cypress  
                             : Add accessibility risk category  
                             : Introduce static analysis (ESLint) to catch JS off-by-one earlier
